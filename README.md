# Foundry VTT Mirror Image

A simple module to add controls to manage the D&D 5e Mirror Image spell.
Buttons are displayed in the token hud to select how many images are currently available on the token.

Macros are provided to toggle, turn on or turn off the UI and flags for a token.  Best used in conjuction with a module like https://github.com/mclemente/fvtt-condition-lab-triggler with a configured condition.
